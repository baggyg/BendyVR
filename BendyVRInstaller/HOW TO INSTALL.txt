Find the Bendy and the Ink Machine directory.
Example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Bendy and the Ink Machine".
Bendy and the Ink Machine.exe is inside this directory.

Extract the mod zip to anywhere (can be on your desktop or whatever, doesn't need to be in the game's directory).

Then drag the Bendy and the Ink Machine.exe file, and drop it on top of BendyVRInstaller.exe.

You should see a command line window with some stuff happening.

In the end it should say "Installed successfully, probably. Press any key to close this console.".

You can now start the game via Bendy and the Ink Machine.exe (or via Steam).
